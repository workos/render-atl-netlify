# Render ATL: Netlify + WorkOS Code Challenge ðŸš€

The challenge, should you choose to accept:

Use AuthKit to add authentication to this full-stack React Router application. Your app should allow users to register for a new account and log in using the following methods:

- Email + password
- Google OAuth
- GitHub OAuth

Good luck!

## Initial set-up

1. Clone this repo and run `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`
3. Create a [new WorkOS account](https://signin.workos.com/sign-up). If you already have an account you'd like to use you can [sign-in](https://signin.workos.com).
4. Go to your [WorkOS dashboard](https://dashboard.workos.com/)
5. Under the Quick start section, copy the `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` and `WORKOS_API_KEY` values and update the corresponding values in `.env`
6. In your terminal, run `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a random secret; copy this value and set `WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD` in `.env`
7. Run the app with `npm run dev`

> NOTE: You may encounter the following error when running `npm run dev`:
>
> ```
> TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')
> ```
>
> This is a bug in React Router that typically occurs on the first run. You can
> refresh the page and the error will go away.
