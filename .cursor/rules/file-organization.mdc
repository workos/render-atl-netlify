# File Organization & Naming

## Directory Structure
- Main application code goes in the `app/` directory
- Routes go in `app/routes/`

## File Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for all files (e.g., `user-profile.tsx`)
- Keep file names descriptive and consistent
- Use `.tsx` for files containing JSX, `.ts` for pure TypeScript
- Make sure new route files are added to `routes.ts` using React Router's APIs for defining routes

## Import Path Organization
- Use the `~/*` alias for app directory imports
- Keep import statements organized and clean
- Remove unused imports

## Code Organization
- Keep related files close together
