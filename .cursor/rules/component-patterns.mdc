# React Component Patterns

## Props and Interfaces
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Use descriptive prop names that indicate purpose
- Provide default values where appropriate

## State Management
- Use useState for simple local component state
- Use useReducer for more complex local state where multiple pieces of state are related
- Use useEffect for side effects and cleanup
- Avoid useEffect in favor of event handlers and derived state when possible
- Lift state up when needed by multiple components

## Component Composition
- Follow the Radix UI patterns for UI components
- Create reusable compound components when appropriate
