# React Router 7 Conventions

## File-Based Routing
- Add all route module files to `app/routes/`
- Use kebab-case for route files (e.g., `user-profile.tsx`)
- Make sure new route files are added to `routes.ts` using React Router's APIs for defining routes

## Data Loading & Actions
- Use proper loader and action patterns for data fetching
- Export loaders and actions as named exports
- Handle loading states and errors appropriately

## Route Components
- Use default exports for route components
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use the Meta export for route metadata
- Handle edge cases like empty states

## Error Handling
- Use React Router's error handling patterns
- Implement ErrorBoundary components
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle network errors gracefully
